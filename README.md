SQL Fundamentals for Healthcare Data

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) that simulate a basic healthcare database structure (Patients, Appointments, Encounters, Prescriptions) and demonstrate core SQL functionalities.

📁 Files and Focus Areas

01_SQL_BASICS.ipynb (DDL/DML): Focuses on creating the database schema and performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Schema: Defines four interconnected tables (patients, appointments, encounters, prescriptions) using PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints.

Key DML: Demonstrates INSERT, SELECT (including WHERE, ORDER BY, and IS NULL), UPDATE, and DELETE commands.

02_JOINS.ipynb (Intermediate DML): Focuses on combining data from multiple tables for relational querying.

Joins Covered: Includes examples for all major join types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and SELF JOIN.

🚀 Getting Started

Open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment or VS Code with an active SQL kernel or database connection.

Run 01_SQL_BASICS.ipynb first to create and populate the necessary tables.

Proceed to 02_JOINS.ipynb for the relational query demonstrations.
